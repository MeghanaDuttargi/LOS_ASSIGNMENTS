Write a Python script that takes two integers as input and calculates their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. 
   Based on the result, determine whether these numbers are co-prime.
   If they are co-prime, print a message indicating that they can be used in cryptographic key generation; otherwise, print a message that they are not suitable.
